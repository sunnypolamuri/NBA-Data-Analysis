## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Collection**

- **Data Sources**: NBA.com, ESPN, Basketball-Reference, or sports data APIs like Sportradar or Stats Perform.
- **Metrics Gathered**:
  - Minutes per game (MPG)
  - Points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks per minute
  - Player Efficiency Ratings (PER)
  - Plus/minus stats for players on and off the floor
- **Timeframes**: Data from recent and previous seasons, with a focus on game-by-game trends for insights over time.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

- **Standardization**: Ensure consistency in player names, positions, and team names.
- **Recency Filtering**: Prioritize recent games (e.g., last 15-20) to highlight current trends.
- **Undervalued Player Identification**:
  - Players with less than 20 MPG but fluctuating minutes.
  - Consistently or increasingly strong performances when given more playtime.

### 3. **Data Analysis**

#### **Player Minutes Trend Analysis**
- Time-series visualizations of MPG trends for each player.
- Alerts for “minute spikes,” indicating significant increases in recent games.

#### **Impact of Minutes on Performance**
- Correlation analysis to measure how minutes impact key stats like points, rebounds, etc.
- Identification of high-impact players with above-average productivity per minute.

#### **Minutes and Efficiency Analysis**
- Comparison of PER and plus/minus stats against minutes played.
- Highlight efficient players with strong court performance, regardless of total minutes.

### 4. **Dashboard Design and Visualization**

- **Tool Used**: Power BI (can adapt to Tableau or Google Data Studio based on requirements).
- **Dashboard Features**:
  - **Player Minutes Tracker**: Displays MPG trends and highlights significant minute changes.
  - **Undervalued Player Watchlist**: Lists players with increasing minutes, key stats, and productivity per minute.
  - **Top Performer Matrix**: Sortable table with players’ minutes, PER, and other stats for easy insights.
  - **Filter Options**: Team, position, and timeframe filters for flexible data views.
  - **Indicators**: “Trending upwards” for positive performance and “low-risk picks” for stable, efficient players.
